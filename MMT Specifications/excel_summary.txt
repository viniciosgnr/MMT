Keep track of all equipment ever installed on the metering system, correlating the physical element serial number with the tag for the place where it is installed. Tracking is done for the entire lifetime of a serial number and for a tag, registering all changes.\n\nIt also has the tag structure for each unit. FPSO and instruments structure set on this module as well as system status (approved by ANP, not approved, decomissioned, comissioning, unavailable etc) will be the basis for the others to work.
